# SachNetra Research Playbook
*The missing fourth doc. The pivot doc says "the quant system is the proof of value" — this doc is **how you actually prove it.** Everything else in the stack is about **collecting** data. This is about **validating** that the data you collect predicts anything.*

---

## Where this sits in the doc stack

```
sachnetra_quant_pivot.md       WHY   — the business, Products A/B/C
sachnetra_quant_roadmap.md     WHAT  — which collectors to build, in what order
cluster_story_entity_architecture.md   HOW (data flows in)
sachnetra_research_playbook.md (this) PROOF — does the collected data work?   ← the gap
```

Build roadmap = James's lane. This doc = **Lijo's lane**: turning the data already in PostgreSQL into validated signals, using the econometrics from the NPTEL series. You can run most of this **today**, on data you already have, without waiting on any new collector.

---

## The core idea (read this even if you read nothing else)

> A data point is worthless until you've shown it predicts something **out of sample**.
> Collecting more data types is *not* research. Proving one signal works *is*.

You already have the right data. The Gemini "what data to collect" list is solved — your roadmap covers it in 10× the depth. The unsolved question is the only one that matters:

**Does an FII outflow / a sentiment drop / an "auditor change" filing actually move the price — and could you have known *before* the move?**

Answering that one sentence, repeatedly, for each signal, is the entire job.

---

## The signal-validation loop

Every research session is one turn of this loop. Do not skip steps. Most fake "alpha" comes from skipping step 5.

```
1. HYPOTHESIS   Write ONE falsifiable sentence with a direction and a horizon.
                "FII net outflow today predicts a NEGATIVE Nifty return over the next 2 days."

2. DATA         Pull only the columns you need. Align timestamps to a daily grid.
                Mind the timezone: announcements are IST (+05:30); align to the IST trading day.

2.5 PREFLIGHT   If the test regresses one series on another, ADF (+KPSS) EACH series first
                (B4 below). A non-stationary leg → use a cointegration test or first-difference,
                never a raw levels regression. This is the spurious-regression guard.

3. TEST         Start with the cheapest test that could kill the hypothesis:
                correlation → simple regression → event study → ARIMA/GARCH.
                Don't reach for GARCH on day one.

4. VALIDATE     Split the data. Fit on the FIRST 70% of dates, test on the LAST 30%.
                A result that only exists in-sample is noise you fooled yourself with.

5. DOCUMENT     Append to the Hypothesis Register (below). Record what you tried,
                the number, and the verdict — INCLUDING the failures. Dead hypotheses
                are the most valuable rows in the register; they stop you re-running them.
```

The discipline that separates research from data-mining: **write the hypothesis down BEFORE you look at the result.** If you peek first and then write the hypothesis to fit, you've proven nothing.

## Experiment 0 — the prerequisite (do this first; nothing works without it)

**You have events but no queryable price series.** `india_institutional_flows`, `india_bourse_announcements`, and `india_news_signals` are all *event/signal* tables. To test "did the price move after the event," you need a **daily price series in a table you can SQL-join against event dates.** `seed-market-quotes.mjs` feeds the live UI — it is not a research-grade historical price store.

**The fix (a research-data task, not a prod collector — keep it in `scripts/research/`):**
- Pull daily OHLCV for **^NSEI (Nifty 50)** and the **Nifty 50 constituents** in `shared/market-taxonomy.json` from Yahoo Finance (free, daily history back ~20 years — covers your FII history from Dec 2009).
- Land it in a `research_prices` table: `(symbol, trade_date, open, high, low, close, adj_close, volume)`, PK `(symbol, trade_date)`.
- Compute daily **log returns** once and store them — every test downstream uses returns, not raw prices.

Until `research_prices` exists, every experiment below is blocked. This is the highest-leverage thing to build for *research* (distinct from the *product* collectors James owns).

> Per `feedback_v2_prod_execution`: I write these scripts; **you run them.** Research scripts read from prod but should write only to `research_*` tables (or a separate DB), never touch `india_*` signal tables.

---

## Your data → the NPTEL syllabus → a runnable experiment

This is the bridge. Each lecture topic becomes an experiment on a table you already have.

| NPTEL topic | Your table(s) | The experiment | "Pass" looks like |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stationarity / ADF test** (pre-req for everything) | `india_news_signals.sentiment_score` daily mean | Is the daily-sentiment series stationary? ADF test. | p < 0.05 → stationary → safe to model directly. If not, difference it first. |
| **ARIMA** | daily mean sentiment | Does sentiment have memory? Fit ARIMA, check if AR terms are significant. | Significant AR(1) → yesterday's mood carries information. |
| **Event study** (your workhorse) | `india_bourse_announcements` + `research_prices` | For `category = 'auditor%'`, compute mean abnormal return over ±5 trading days around `announced_at`. | A clean, significant drop in the days *after* the filing = a real event signal. |
| **GARCH** | `research_prices` returns + `india_institutional_flows` | Do FII outflow spikes precede volatility *clusters* (not just direction)? | Lagged |FII net| improves a GARCH variance forecast. |
| **Multi-factor / APT** | announcements as 0/1 dummies + returns | Regress stock returns on event dummies (auditor change, pledge, board outcome). | A dummy with a significant, stable coefficient = a tradable factor. |
| **Extreme Value Theory** | sentiment + FII tails | Do the worst 1% sentiment days coincide with the worst Nifty days? | Tail co-occurrence well above chance = a crash early-warning candidate. |
| **Lead-lag / Granger causality** | `announced_at` vs `india_news_signals.published_at` | Do bourse filings lead the news by hours? (Product A's whole thesis.) | Filings systematically precede the matching headline = the latency edge is real. |

Watch a lecture → pick its row → run that experiment. That turns passive watching into research.

## The five experiments to run first (in order)

Sequenced by *cheapness-to-disprove* and by how load-bearing they are for your business thesis.

### Exp 1 — Does FII flow predict the next-day Nifty move?
- **Data:** `india_institutional_flows` (FII, cash segment, `net`) + `research_prices` (^NSEI return).
- **Test:** regress next-1-day and next-2-day Nifty log return on today's FII `net`. Then lag it the other way as a sanity check (does the Nifty predict FII? — if *that's* stronger, your signal is just a coincident indicator, not a leading one).
- **Why first:** you have 3,964 rows back to Dec 2009 (V2-017b). Longest, cleanest series you own. If *this* doesn't work, be very skeptical of everything noisier.

### Exp 2 — Do bourse announcements move prices? (event study)
- **Data:** `india_bourse_announcements` (17,322 rows) + `research_prices` for the matching `symbol`.
- **Test:** event study, ±5 trading days, grouped by `category`. Rank categories by post-event abnormal return.
- **Why:** this is the empirical core of **Product A**. If "auditor change" / "promoter pledge" categories show a real post-filing drift, you have a sellable signal. If nothing moves, Product A's thesis needs a rethink *before* the OCR app gets built.

### Exp 3 — Is news sentiment a stationary, autocorrelated series? (ARIMA pre-flight)
- **Data:** `india_news_signals.sentiment_score`, daily mean.
- **Test:** ADF test → if stationary, fit ARIMA(p,d,q), inspect AR significance.
- **Why:** decides whether *any* time-series model on sentiment is even valid. Cheap, foundational, and directly exercises the early NPTEL lectures.

### Exp 4 — Does the bourse lead the newswire? (latency edge)
- **Data:** `india_bourse_announcements.announced_at` vs `india_news_signals.published_at`, matched by `symbol`/`companies`.
- **Test:** for matched events, distribution of (news time − filing time). Median > 0 by hours = edge confirmed.
- **Why:** the pivot doc claims "market reacts in minutes, journalists take hours." This *measures* that claim instead of asserting it. One of the most compelling slides you could put in front of a B2B pilot.

### Exp 5 — Do sentiment + flow tails line up with market shocks? (EVT teaser)
- **Data:** worst-decile sentiment days + largest FII-outflow days vs worst ^NSEI return days.
- **Test:** co-occurrence rate vs random baseline; later, fit a Generalized Pareto to the tail.
- **Why:** turns your OSINT/sentiment collection into a *risk* product, not just a *direction* product — a different and arguably easier sell.

## The traps that invalidate research (best-practices checklist)

These are why most retail "backtests" are fiction. Check every one before you believe a result.

- **Look-ahead bias** — using data you wouldn't have had at decision time. If FII flows for day T publish *after* market close on T, you cannot trade on them until T+1. Align to *availability* time, not *event* time.
- **Survivorship bias** — testing only on companies that still exist / are still in the Nifty. Delisted/bankrupt names are exactly where auditor-resignation alpha lives. Note this as a known limitation of any Nifty-50-only test.
- **Timezone drift** — `announced_at` is IST (+05:30); Yahoo prices are exchange-local. A naive UTC join silently misaligns a whole trading day. Pin everything to the IST trading calendar.
- **Multiple-testing / p-hacking** — test 20 hypotheses, ~1 looks "significant" at p<0.05 by pure chance. The Hypothesis Register (logging failures too) is your defense: it shows how many shots you took.
- **In-sample only** — covered above. Always hold out the last 30% of dates.
- **Tiny-N event studies** — 6 "auditor change" filings is a story, not statistics. Note the N on every event-study result; be loud when it's small.
- **Non-stationarity** — running correlation/regression on a trending (non-stationary) series produces confident nonsense. ADF **and KPSS** first (B3 below); for any two-series regression, the B4 preflight is mandatory (Exp 3 exists for this reason).

## Mandatory diagnostic discipline (B1–B4)

*Added 2026-05-28 from the NPTEL time-series course follow-up (`scratch/nptel_ts_learning_followups_checklist.md` §B). These are not experiments — they are rules every future `Exp*.md` inherits and the signal-validation loop now encodes. One paragraph each.*

**B1 — Theil's U is the parsimony gate.** Any experiment reporting a forecast or a directional/predictive model must report **Theil's U** against the naive baseline ("tomorrow = today"). If **U ≥ 1 the model is rejected** regardless of in-sample p-values — it has not beaten the dumbest possible forecast. AIC/BIC choose the best model *among candidates*; Theil's U checks that the winner actually beats doing nothing. (`WHAT_I_LEARNED.md` §9.)

**B2 — Squared-residual Ljung-Box is the mandatory third diagnostic.** Whenever an experiment fits a mean model (ARIMA, regression, event-study residual), the diagnostic block must include **Ljung-Box on the *squared* residuals**, not just the raw residuals. Raw-pass + squared-fail = the model captured the mean but missed the volatility process; the verdict is **provisional until a GARCH layer is fitted**. (`WHAT_I_LEARNED.md` §7.3.)

**B3 — ADF and KPSS together, never ADF alone.** Stationarity calls use **both** tests (opposite nulls). Agreement → a confident call. Disagreement is itself a finding — trend-stationary vs difference-stationary — and changes the transform (detrend vs difference). Cheap; prevents a real class of error. (`WHAT_I_LEARNED.md` §2.4.)

**B4 — Stationarity preflight before every regression-style experiment.** Before regressing one series on another, **ADF (+KPSS, per B3) each series first**. If any leg is non-stationary, either justify the regression with a cointegration test (Engle-Granger / Johansen — see [[Exp12]]) or first-difference. Regressing two non-stationary series without this is **spurious regression** — confident nonsense (`WHAT_I_LEARNED.md` §13). Encoded as step 2.5 of the signal-validation loop above.

> Applied retroactively to in-flight work: [[Exp12]] (cointegration) is the canonical B4 case — it *is* the cointegration-test justification a non-stationary-leg regression requires. [[Exp13]] (Hurst) is a descriptive estimator with no mean model, so B1/B2 do not bind; its §9 already notes the no-p-value caveat.

## Hypothesis Register (the living output of all research)

Append one row per experiment. **Log failures** — they're the most valuable rows. This is the artifact that compounds; in a year it's a moat (it's literally the R&D log a Product C buyer or a WorldQuant relationship would want to see).

BUT: median only ~13min; 40% of pairs are news-BEFORE (matching noise); large-cap-ONLY because just ~1.7% of news is ticker-tagged — and large-caps are where the wire is fastest, so this is the FLOOR.

| H14 (re-run 3, post-G7) | 2026-05-29 | (same) — re-run after G7: Smallcap 250 prices (`research_prices` →444 symbols) + 2yr filings backfill (297,033 inserted) | `india_bourse_announcements` (2yr) + `research_prices` (444 sym), ^NSEI | same | funnel 4,713 governance → **892 priced** (was 49) → **685 usable** (was 12); **pledge_increase N=9 POST −312bps t=−2.34 p<.05** (predicted sign — FIRST signal); promoter_pledge N=10 −255bps p<.10; **auditor_resignation N=15 null (−8bps)**; pledge signal concentration-sensitive (−312→−95 top-3 dropped) | in-sample only; neither primary unit cleared N≥20 | 🟡 **promising** | **First life in the #1 strategy.** The PLEDGE leg shows the hypothesised negative governance-shock drift, significant; the AUDITOR-RESIGNATION leg is flat. Not ✅ SUPPORTED — N<20 + concentration-sensitive + not cost-tested. Do NOT paper-trade (needs ✅). Next: monthly re-run as filings accrue + extend prices below Smallcap 250; ~2× more pledge events needed to clear N≥20. Full write-up [[Exp14]]. |

Governance-shock arbitrage looks like noise on the priceable universe. Caveats vs hard-❌: pledge still N=13, + survivorship floor (3,280 distressed filings unpriceable). Do NOT paper-trade; accrue pledge events to N≥20 before promote/park. Full write-up [[Exp14]]. |

Both primary buckets cleared N≥20 by huge margins and show zero tradable drift. Remaining caveat: survivorship is NOT escaped — Yahoo excludes delisted names where academic −5/−12% CAR likely lives, but those are unshortable for retail anyway. **PARK governance-shock; pivot to G1 (news-tagging) / news-latency lane.** Full write-up [[Exp14]]. |

## How to use Claude in a research session (so usage isn't wasted)

High-value, in rough order:
1. **Write the analysis scripts** — `scripts/research/event_study.mjs`, ADF/ARIMA harnesses — that you then run. Math → runnable code on your real rows.
2. **Translate a lecture you just watched** into its experiment row in the table above.
3. **Sanity-check a result** — "is this t-stat meaningful given N=14?" / "did I look-ahead bias myself here?"
4. **Survey a specific best practice** (event-study window choice, GARCH spec) when you hit it — narrow questions, not "explain all of quant finance."

Low-value (don't spend usage here): re-deriving the data-source list (done), generic "what is GARCH" explainers (the NPTEL series does this better), or anything that writes to prod `india_*` tables.

---

## Boundaries (inherited from CLAUDE.md + memory)

- Research scripts live in `scripts/research/`, read prod, write only `research_*` tables. Never modify `india_*` signal tables or any sacred file.
- Per `feedback_v2_prod_execution`: Claude authors scripts + read-only checks; **Lijo runs them** against the DB.
- The Redis/DB credentials in `.env.local` never leave the machine — not into Gemini, not into shared docs.

## Changelog

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-05-22 | Initial doc. Created as the fourth strategy doc (proof/validation layer) to fill the gap that pivot/roadmap/architecture are all collection-focused. Grounded in the live schemas in `migrate-india-signals.mjs`. Defined the signal-validation loop, Experiment 0 (price-series prerequisite), the NPTEL→table→experiment bridge, the first five experiments, the bias checklist, and the Hypothesis Register. |
| 2026-05-23 | Appended **H9** to the Hypothesis Register — validated-estimator replication of H7's GARCH-X test on \|FII flow\|→next-day variance. Run executed against prod 2026-05-23; reproduced H7 to three sig figs (γ=−0.0019, LR=0.77, p=0.38), outflow-only and post-2012 subsamples also null, fixed self-test recovers γ cleanly (LR p=4.2e-5). Verdict ❌ null CONFIRMED. H7 + H9 together close the GARCH-X / flow→variance question for the symmetric-Gaussian GARCH(1,1) class. |
| 2026-05-24 | Appended **H10** to the Hypothesis Register — intraday event study of tagged-large-cap NSE filings. Run executed against prod 2026-05-24 (task-106); verdict is ⬜ inconclusive + 🚩 suspect due to concentration check failure. |
| 2026-05-28 | Added the **Mandatory diagnostic discipline (B1–B4)** section + step 2.5 PREFLIGHT in the validation loop, from the NPTEL course follow-up (`nptel_ts_learning_followups_checklist.md` §B): B1 Theil's U parsimony gate, B2 squared-residual Ljung-Box, B3 ADF+KPSS together, B4 stationarity preflight before regression. Pre-registered **Exp 12** (cointegration pairs) and **Exp 13** (rolling Hurst regime) as parallel research tracks to the gated Exp 11 latency thesis; H12/H13 register rows to be appended after Lijo's prod runs. |
| 2026-06-05 | Appended **H16** to the Hypothesis Register — long-only mid-cap PEAD via a day-0 EAR proxy (Exp16). Pre-registered ([[exp16_brief]]) with a §5b extreme-move amendment locked before stats; data-quality spot-check passed; run executed against prod 2026-06-05. Verdict ❌ **NULL** — gross drift ≈+0.5% (ns, p 0.36–0.56), net<0 at 100/250bps, DSR 0.000 / Theil 1.34 / ADF·KPSS reject; N=105. Key limit found: `india_bourse_announcements` only spans 2024-05→2026-05, so H16c (recency) is untestable — unblock is a historical filings backfill. PEAD pilot claimed Exp16; G6 sentiment-calibration takes Exp17. Pivot to **G1** (news-tagging alias normalization). Full write-up [[Exp16]]. |
